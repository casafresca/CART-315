# Make a Thing

## Design Process Overview

My process for developing an idea for this game prototype began when I was introduced to Game Boy Studio in class. As a big Nintendo fan, I was immediately intrigued by software that makes it accessible to develop Game Boy–style games. I knew right away that I wanted to create a Game Boy game of my own. However, since I had never used Game Boy Studio before, my first step was to watch an online tutorial to learn the basics of the engine.

## Learning Tools and Assets

While watching the tutorial, I learned two important things related to pixel art. The first was the existence of Aseprite, a pixel art creation tool that integrates very well with Game Boy Studio. This interested me because it allowed me to experiment with a new piece of software alongside the game engine itself. The second thing I learned was a common technique used by developers who are not primarily pixel artists: downloading free or paid pixel art assets online and modifying them in Aseprite to better fit a game’s style and needs.

Using this approach, I visited itch.io and downloaded a variety of free pixel art assets. Browsing through these different sprites helped me decide what kind of game I wanted to create. One of the sprites I found was a small, cute fox, and I realized that it had been a while since I had seen a video game with an adorable animal mascot as the main playable character. Because of this, I decided to develop a simple platformer starring the fox.

## Level Design and Mechanics

After choosing the main character, I reviewed the other assets I had downloaded and began creating level art by combining them into a single scene. I decided to set the game in a forest environment to match the fox character, but I intentionally used darker, more ominous décor to contrast with the fox’s cute appearance.

I then implemented familiar platformer mechanics, such as jumping on enemies and collecting coins. While the coins function as basic collectibles, their placement within the level adds strategic value and helps guide player movement.

## Narrative and Atmosphere

The inclusion of enemies also contributes to the game’s darker atmosphere and world-building. I believe this allows players to create their own head-canon about what may have happened in the forest based on its tone and visual design.

Finally, after discovering a visually striking sword sprite, I decided to make collecting the sword the primary goal of the game. The narrative idea is that the fox must travel through the forest to retrieve the sword and defeat the remaining monsters. Although the game currently ends once the fox collects the sword, this concept could be expanded further in a future, more complete build.
